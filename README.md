# Binary-Search-Tree-in-c++
Binary Search Tree or A BST is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:    
1.The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.     
2.The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.    
3.The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Following are the basic operations of a tree −

    Search − Searches an element in a tree.

    Insert − Inserts an element in a tree.

    Pre-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

    In-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

    Post-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
